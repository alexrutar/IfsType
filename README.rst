IfsType: Iterated Function System Simulation Library
====================================================

This library is a simulation library iterated function systems of contractive similitudes on the real line.
See (TODO: add link) for a description of the theory behind this project.
The primary purpose of the library is to generate the transition graph of such an IFS, and to provide tools for working with and analyzing the transition graph.

Main features:

* Exact precision rational and algebraic numbers.
* Symbolic computation of transition matrices.
* Visualization tools: transition graph drawing, and IFS visualization through intervals.
