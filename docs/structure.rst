Library Organization
====================

.. currentmodule:: ifstype

The library consists of five distinct modules:

* :mod:`ifstype.ifs`: core functionality of iterated function systems
* :mod:`ifstype.generations`: compute children of net intervals and other depedency relationships; generate transition graph
* :mod:`ifstype.graph`: the transition graph class and related methods
* ``algorithms``: some easy-to-use algorithms as examples and common use cases
* ``examples``: example iterated function systems of various types
* ``info``: write information about the IFS and TransitionGraph objects
